Ever wondered just how many points the game used to generate a raid? Are you getting the maximum 10,000 point raids yet? Now you'll know because you can see exactly how many raid points are used to generate every raid and many other types of incidents.

For an even more educational experience, you can also view a threat points breakdown that shows the details of how the points were calculated, line by line. This option will not work and/or make sense with mods that alter the way threat points are calculated.

Note: This mod is now fully compatible with my other mod, Unlimited Threat Scale: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562732435 in version 1.5+ of RimWorld. Unlimited Threat Scale must be before this mod in the mod order list.
